We are soldiers in the army - we got to fight but some will have to die- we gotta hold up the blood stain banner we have to hold it up until we die - so Br. Derval hey he was a soldier alight, he had his hand on the gospel gun... (Classic)
I am on the battle field for my lord
Closer than a brother my Jesus is to me
Lift Jesus higher a little higher from this earth to eternity
I am in the Lord's army
Happy happy happy happy in The Lord , keeping gods commandments and trusting in his word
Jesus is the rock on which I stand
With Christ in the vessel
I found a new life
Roll Jordan Roll
Fire fire Fire
Daniels god surely will deliver
Satan is a sly old fox
Have you heard if the Advent Church of God how she is moving according to prophecy
He's my rock my sword my shield he's he wheel in the middle of the wheel
Jesus on on the telephone tell him what u need right now
Some sweet day I'm going away
I feel like a fire shot up in my bones
We shall have a grand time up in heaven
I've got the spirit in my hand and it's keeping me alive
Jesus on the mainline - Trini version

The time to be happy is now

Everywhere he went
Love is a flag flown high
Hear my cry oh lord attend onto my prayer
Press along saints

Soon and. Very soon we are going to see the king
